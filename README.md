Reading is a beloved pastime that transports us to different worlds, sparks our imagination, and fosters personal growth. However, finding new books that align with our interests and connecting with fellow book enthusiasts can be a daunting task. This project aims to address these challenges by creating an online social network tailored specifically for book lovers.

The platform will offer an intuitive and user-friendly interface accessible via web and mobile devices. Users can create personalized reading lists, track their reading journeys, and explore robust search tools and dedicated author/genre pages to discover new books tailored to their preferences.
